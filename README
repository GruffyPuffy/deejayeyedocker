This is a docker container for the deejayeye-modder tool.
Check this out: https://github.com/Bin4ry/deejayeye-modder/

Usage:
- Install "docker" (see docker.com for info)
- Clone this repo into a local directory.
- From that, execute the "build.sh". This will build and Ubuntu 16.04 with all dependencies for deejayeye-modder. Note that this might take some time...patience!
- When this has succeeded place your original APK (see deejayeye-modder docs) in the directory and name it "orig.apk".
- Execute "run.sh" and follow the instructions.
- After execution the result can be found in the "output" directory.

Update:
Docker for Windows users:
- Enable sharing (to get the output from the executed patch)
- Update the run.bat with correct path to your output directory (default: D:\docker\deejayeyedocker)

Now tested on Windows 10 Pro + Docker for Windows as well as Ubuntu 18.04.

Good luck!
